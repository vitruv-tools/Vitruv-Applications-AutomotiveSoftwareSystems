#Automotive Software Systems Application

The *Automotive Software Systems Application* repository contains all projects for the automotive case study of the [Vitruv framework](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/Vitruv/) and its [reactions language](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/Vitruv/wiki/The-Reactions-Language).

***Important:*** Since changes on the Vitruv framework are necessary which are not yet committed to the master branch, please be sure to use the [ChangesForAutomotiveSoftwareSystemsApplication](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/Vitruv/tree/ChangesForAutomotiveSoftwareSystemsApplication) Vitruv branch to run the transformations of this case study.
